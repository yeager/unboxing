"Handle for you the installation of downloaded Deb packages for Ubuntu and "
"their dependencies. Simply double-click, confirm, enter your password, and "
"wait. Note that while the app is intended to mirror Sideload, and thought as "
"a fallback to install from deprecated packaging, it comes from a third "
"party, and not from the elementary OS team. Please do not file any issue "
"related to this app and its use to them. It may be more than enough for one "
"single stray package, and to help out people uncomfortable with the "
"terminal, but any more advanced function will be better served by the "
"commandline. Make sure to install only packages that are intended for your "
"version of elementary OS or its underlying Ubuntu version, and which are not "
"distributed in AppCenter elementary OS 7: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS elementary OS 8: "
"Ubuntu 24.04 LTS If you like this application please do not hesitate to do a "
"donation. This takes a lot of time, and is done to help people."
